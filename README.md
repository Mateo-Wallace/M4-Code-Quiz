# M4-Code-Quiz

## Description

This application is a quiz that determines your score based on your final time. Every time you choose an incorrect answer the timer descends by 10 seconds. It is primarily built on JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to learn to implement API's and advanced JS.
While building this project I learned how to:

- Run a timer
- Save a JSON file to local storage and pull its contents on another webpage
- Use CSS to style every n'th child
- Select elements by ID and create children elements
- Use CSS: "display: none;" in order to hide divs and use JavaScript: ".classList.add() and .classList.remove()" to add and remove said class
